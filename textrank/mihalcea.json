["Compatibility of systems of linear constraints over the set of natural numbers.\nCriteria of compatibility of a system of linear Diophantine equations, strict\ninequations, and nonstrict inequations are considered. Upper bounds for\ncomponents of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction of\nminimal generating sets of solutions for all types of systems are given. \nThese criteria and the corresponding algorithms for constructing a minimal\nsupporting set of solutions can be used in solving all the considered types\nsystems and systems of mixed types."]
