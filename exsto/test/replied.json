My personal experience with Spark core is that it performs really\nwell once you tune it properly.\n\nAs far I understand SparkSQL under the hood performs many of these\noptimizations (order of Spark operations) and uses a more efficient storage\nformat. Is this assumption correct?\n\nHas anyone done any comparison of SparkSQL with Impala ? The fact that many\nof the queries don't even finish in the benchmark is quite surprising and\nhard to believe.\n\nA few months ago there were a few emails about Spark not being able to\nhandle large volumes (TBs) of data. That myth was busted recently when the\nfolks at Databricks published their sorting record results.\n\n\nThanks\n-Soumya\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Oct 31, 2014 at 7:35 PM, Du Li <lidu@yahoo-inc.com> wrote:\n\n>   We have seen all kinds of results published that often contradict each\n> other.
